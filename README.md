# pearl-legal

This repository is dedicated to tracking the changes we make to any legal documentation given to our customers. One of our goals is to be as transparent as possible and to allow anyone to judge our business practices easily.

The purpose of this repository is threefold:

* **Ask questions**: 
Sometimes legal jargon can be difficult to understand. If you need a clearer explanation of what specific terms mean or what their implications are for your business, we want to help.

* **Raise concerns**: 
Perhaps something in our documentation doesn't sit well with you. We're open to any and all criticism of our work.

* **Suggest changes**: 
In the event that you notice confusing wording or think of an addition which would reasonably benefit your business, you can file a pull request (see How to Contribute below) and we'll review your changes. It could very well end up in the next version of our legal documentation.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute, you can go ahead and [create a new issue](https://github.com/hellopearlcare/legal/issues/new). This will require a GitHub account but should be a relatively easy process.

If your question or concern is more private or you don't want a GitHub account, you can email us at service@hellopearl.co and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. However, we do encourage open discussion of our terms.
